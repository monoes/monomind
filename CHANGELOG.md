# Changelog

All notable changes to Monomind (`monomind` umbrella + `@monoes/monomindcli`).

## [2.8.0] — 2026-07-31

### Antigravity (agy) Support

Monomind now officially supports **Google Antigravity (agy)** alongside Claude Code.

#### What's new

- **`monomind init` generates Antigravity files** — every init run now also creates:
  - `GEMINI.md` — agent instructions and MCP tool rules read by agy
  - `.gemini/rules/monomind.md` — workflow rules file (when to call monograph, memory, knowledge_search)
  - `.gemini/helpers/statusline.sh` — shell wrapper that drives the agy status bar
  - `.gemini/helpers/statusline.cjs` + `utils/` — full Node.js statusline engine (same as Claude Code)
  - `.gemini/settings.json` — wires `statusLine.command` so the status bar appears automatically

- **Status bar in agy** — the Monomind status bar (graph node count, stale nodes, agent routing, git state, session cost) now appears at the bottom of the agy chat window, exactly as it does in Claude Code's terminal UI. No manual setup required after `monomind init`.

- **Global agy settings auto-wired** — `monomind init` also updates `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` and writes `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/statusline.sh` so the status bar works even before project-level init has run.

- **Org Runtime — multi-LLM providers** — `monomind org run` now supports `gemini` and `openai` provider kinds in org JSON files:
  ```json
  { "provider": { "kind": "gemini", "apiKeyEnv": "GEMINI_API_KEY" } }
  ```
  Org role sessions resolve `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment without embedding secrets.

- **`isDevRepo` sentinel relaxed** — the `[STALE_HELPERS]` check in `session-restore-handler.cjs` now correctly suppresses auto-heal when running inside the monomind dev repository (only `packages/@monomind/cli/package.json` presence required; no longer also requires the bundled `.claude/helpers` subtree).

## [2.5.0] — 2026-07-18


### Orgs can read your Second Brain
- Org agents get a `knowledge_search` tool: merged semantic search over the project's documents **and** your personal global brain, with the same project-first ranking as every other surface. Role briefings instruct agents to ground work in your actual documents; every lookup is a bus event visible in `org logs` / `org report`.

### Live document ingestion
- The dashboard server (long-lived, warm embedding model) watches the project and ingests changed `md/txt/pdf/docx` in-process within ~5 seconds of a save — no session restart needed. Platforms without recursive watch fall back silently to the session-start reindex.

### Global-brain polish
- Dashboard Second Brain search: project/global/all scope selector, `global` badges, real source-file labels.
- README + the generated per-project CLAUDE.md now teach the cross-project brain (auto-routing, `--store`, `--global`, OKF portability).

## [2.4.0] — 2026-07-18

### Global Second Brain (cross-project)
- One personal knowledge store at `~/.monomind/global-brain` (relocatable via `MONOMIND_GLOBAL_BRAIN_DIR`), structurally exempt from `cleanup --data`.
- **Zero-decision routing:** `doc ingest` on a path outside the current project auto-routes to the global brain (announced, overridable); `--global` forces it; `doc list/export --global`.
- **Merged retrieval everywhere:** `doc search`, the warm `/api/knowledge/search` endpoint, and per-prompt `[SECOND_BRAIN]` injection query project + global; project results win ties, global hits are labeled.
- Memory bridge refactored from a first-caller-wins singleton to a per-store instance cache (also fixes a latent store-misroute); excerpt provenance rides the `src:` ingest tag end-to-end.

## [2.3.x] — 2026-07-18

### 2.3.4 — Swarm-review hardening (round 2)
- Chunker: code-fence awareness (`#` lines in ``` blocks are never headings), CRLF normalization, backward-scan loop guards. (`@monoes/memory@1.0.8`)
- Memory engine: `UNIQUE(namespace,key)` enforced in better-sqlite3 (existing DBs deduped newest-wins), TTL-expired entries excluded from search, streaming row iteration.
- Org runtime: unified boss-selection for `org_complete` gating; `org answer` merges by question id instead of clobbering; `org logs` skips corrupt interior lines; `--run` flag validated; doc-metadata removal via append-only tombstones with compaction.
- Every failed CLI command now prints its failure reason (dispatcher-level fix).

Also in the 2.3.4 cycle: a 49-agent adversarial review of the week's modules confirmed 33 findings — **all 33 fixed**, including a critical `cleanup --data` rule that would have deleted live memory stores, and a silent org message-loss window during session restarts. Ledger: `docs/mastermind/plans/2026-07-18-swarm-review-findings.md`.

### 2.3.3 — Semantic per-prompt knowledge injection
- The dashboard server holds the local embedding model warm and serves `/api/knowledge/search` in ~60ms; every substantive Claude Code prompt gets its top knowledge excerpts injected automatically (`[SECOND_BRAIN]`), with tokenized keyword fallback and visible `(semantic)`/`(keyword)` provenance. Injection telemetry (never prompt text) in `.monomind/metrics/second-brain.jsonl`.

### 2.3.2 — Second Brain foundations
- Heading-aware chunking with `§ section` context prefixes; session-start reindex of changed documents; retrieval golden-set eval grown to 18 cases (80% paraphrase recall bar).
- Org cross-run memory: run outcomes stored per `memory_namespace`, `org_recall` tool for agents.
- `cleanup --data`: provable pruning of orphaned per-project stores via origin markers.
- Doctor: Second Brain model check.

### 2.3.1 — Memory engine replaced (LanceDB removed)
- The memory/Second Brain engine is now local SQLite (better-sqlite3, sql.js WASM fallback) storing text + embedding vectors, with local MiniLM embeddings — **~600MB of native dependencies removed** (`@lancedb/lancedb`, `apache-arrow`, onnx runtime stays for embeddings). (`@monoes/memory@1.0.6`)
- Fixed: semantic search over the native backend returned nothing (empty stub); keyword search required whole-phrase matches; namespace filters leaked across namespaces.
- Retrieval quality became a tested invariant: paraphrase golden-set eval in CI.

### 2.3.0 — Org Runtime v2 capability wave
- **Observability:** `org logs --follow` (live event tail), `org report` (outcome, per-role tokens vs budget, assets, crashes; `--all` for run history).
- **Outcomes + memory:** coordinator records run outcomes via `org_complete`; next run is briefed on the last; history in `<org>/history.jsonl`.
- **Headless HIL:** `org questions` / `org answer` — answer `ask_human` from the terminal, live or queued.
- **Resilience:** crashed agent sessions restart with backoff; crash detection in `org status`.
- **DX:** `org run --dry-run` (role-briefing preview), `org create --template content-team|dev-team|research-pod`, `org validate` (schema + structural invariants), informative `org list`, running-org guards on `stop`/`delete`.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-07-17 and earlier

- Org Runtime v2 (SDK daemon) baseline: per-role live agent sessions, `org_send` message bus, policy-gated tools, dashboard event forwarding, cross-process org discovery.
